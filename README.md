Abandoned
=========


Abandoned is a text based, science-fiction, survival adventure game. You are stranded on a space station and must collect pieces of your escape pod to disembark from this hellzone. The space station you are on is randomly created every time, and the items within the rooms are random as well. Every new game results in new hours of fun. This game was created by Holden Oullette, Isaac Noland, and Andrew Soltesz and version 1.0 of Abandoned was created in 24 hours as part of a coding challenge. They won the "Best Game Architecture" as a result.
